These were the main intention for this website, because you can get all the new games directly into your feed reader or combine it with <a href="https://ifttt.com" target="_blank">IFTTT</a>, and let yourself send e-mails, push notifications, Slack messages, post them to your wordpress based blog etc...<br/>
Take a look at the demo recipes in the next section.'}
